**A production-style decision engine combining rule-based control with AI signals to produce explainable, auditable outcomes.**

Aether Engine demonstrates how real-world AI systems move beyond model outputs by structuring decision pipelines that remain transparent, testable, and production-ready.

---

## Highlights

- Hybrid AI + rules decision pipeline  
- Explainable & auditable decision logic  
- Async processing & scalable architecture  
- Modular, vertical-ready system design  
- Production-oriented structure & observability  
- Built with FastAPI, Celery, Redis, and Docker  

---

## Why this project exists

In real systems, AI outputs alone are rarely sufficient.

Decisions must be:

- explainable  
- auditable  
- controllable  
- resilient to edge cases  

Aether Engine explores a hybrid approach where **AI provides signals** and **rules provide control**, producing decisions that remain transparent and debuggable.

This architecture is common in finance, insurance, logistics, and SaaS platforms operating in regulated or high-risk environments.

---

## Architecture Overview

1. Client Request  
2. API & Validation  
3. Rule Evaluation  
4. AI Signals  
5. Decision Assembly  
6. Structured Decision Output  
7. Logging & Metrics


The pipeline keeps AI outputs separate from final decisions, ensuring inspectability and safety.

## Agent Framework

Aether Engine is designed to evolve into an AI-native decision platform.

To support intelligent automation across multiple industries, the engine includes a foundation for **decision agents** and **domain skill packs**.

### Decision Agents

Decision agents represent reusable reasoning roles within the decision pipeline, such as:

- intake interpretation
- decision validation
- exception detection
- workflow routing
- compliance & policy enforcement

These agents orchestrate workflows while preserving explainability, auditability, and human control.

### Domain Skill Packs

Domain skill packs provide domain-specific knowledge without modifying the core engine.

**Examples:**

- **Paintly** → surface interpretation, painting scope logic, upsell suggestions  
- **Finance & Risk** → risk policies, fraud signals, compliance rules  
- **Logistics** → routing priorities and disruption handling  
- **Healthcare operations** → protocol validation and claims workflows  

This separation allows Aether Engine to scale across verticals while maintaining governance, transparency, and control.

> The agent framework is introduced incrementally and does not add runtime complexity to current workflows.

## What this project demonstrates

- Structuring AI-assisted decision systems beyond notebooks and scripts  
- Combining deterministic rules with AI-derived signals  
- Designing modular backend services using FastAPI  
- Keeping AI outputs separate from decision logic  
- Engineering for explainability, validation, and extensibility  
- Building systems that remain debuggable in production

## Example Use Case: Pricing & Intake Automation

A vertical included in this repository demonstrates an automated intake and pricing workflow.

### Flow

1. Structured input is received via API  
2. Domain rules and heuristics are applied  
3. Optional AI signals influence outcomes  
4. A structured decision object is returned  

This use case illustrates system design rather than a finished product.

## Real-World Application: Paintly

**Paintly** is a practical implementation built on Aether Engine.

It is an AI-assisted intake and quotation engine for painting contractors that automates the intake → estimation → quotation workflow while keeping decisions transparent and rule-driven.

### Automated analysis includes

- Estimating rooms and surfaces from uploaded photos  
- Detecting work type (interior, exterior, renovation, new build)  
- Complexity indicators such as height, edges, and surface condition  

Combined with:

- pricing rules  
- labor & material logic  
- company-specific settings  

### Output

- structured work estimate  
- price calculation  
- professional quotation (HTML/PDF)  

Paintly automates administrative and estimation tasks while preserving professional control.

## Design Principles

**Explainability first** — decisions must be inspectable  
**Separation of concerns** — AI signals ≠ final decisions  
**Extensibility** — supports new models and verticals  
**Safety & control** — rule layers enforce constraints  
**Production mindset** — structured, testable, observable  

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI, Python  
**Async & Messaging:** Celery, Redis  
**AI / Data:** PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS S3  
**Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Project Structure

- **api/** — FastAPI routes  
- **core/** — shared configuration & utilities  
- **services/** — orchestration & domain services  
- **ai/** — AI-related components  
- **auth/** — authentication utilities  
- **verticals/** — domain-specific implementations

## How AI is used

AI components act as **supporting signals**, not opaque decision-makers:

- lightweight scoring & classification  
- optional ML outputs influencing decisions  
- rule-based final decisions for transparency  

This keeps the system inspectable and easy to debug.

---

## Trade-offs & Scope

- Models are intentionally lightweight  
- No heavy training pipelines are included  
- Focus is system design rather than model performance  
- Synthetic/sample data used for demonstration  

---

## Possible Extensions

- external inference services  
- feedback loops & retraining pipelines  
- decision audit trails & explainability logs  
- feature store integration  
- A/B testing decision strategies  
- multi-tenant decision policy management  

---

## Purpose

This repository explores how applied AI systems can be:

- engineered cleanly  
- reasoned about and audited  
- extended safely  
- integrated into real-world backend services  

It is an applied AI engineering project focused on production-ready decision system design.
